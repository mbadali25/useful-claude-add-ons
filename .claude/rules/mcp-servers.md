Code map anchor `6475c41c`; if it is behind HEAD, re-check with `git diff --name-only 6475c41c..HEAD -- <cited paths>`.
## Landmines
- The credential chain caches its winner for the process lifetime.
- `scopesOverride` silently broadens a narrow scope request.
- `dist/` is what runs, `src/` is what you edit.
- The stale-build gap in the TEST path is CLOSED (2026-09-06, commit `4e2bfb78`).
- `o365-user` does not use the admin credential chain at all.
- Each server pins an exact core version, not a range.
