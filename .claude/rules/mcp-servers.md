# mcp-servers
Code map anchor `f7ffc1d2`; if it is behind HEAD, re-check with `git diff --name-only f7ffc1d2..HEAD -- <cited paths>`.
Covers: The TypeScript monorepo — four stdio MCP servers over one shared core. Holds the two recorded adminAuth.ts defects (TODO items 2 and 3), still open. GraphClient sends its token only to its base origin (T-0090). Not a marketplace plugin; nothing registers it.; re-anchored to a7c29371 (L-0520, the merge train, crew 1.0.76); re-anchored to f7ffc1d2 (L-0520 pre-review hardening)
## Landmines
- The credential chain caches its winner for the process lifetime.
- `scopesOverride` silently broadens a narrow scope request.
- `dist/` is what runs, `src/` is what you edit.
- The stale-build gap in the TEST path is CLOSED (2026-09-06, commit `4e2bfb78`).
- `o365-user` does not use the admin credential chain at all.
- Each server pins an exact core version, not a range.
