Covers: The TypeScript monorepo — four stdio MCP servers over one shared core. Holds the two recorded adminAuth.ts defects (TODO items 2 and 3), still open. GraphClient sends its token only to its base origin (T-0090). Not a marketplace plugin; nothing registers it.; re-anchored to c4e2eb98 (L-0520 PR 1, the merge train CLI, after merging main 42d5ef58 (T-0094)); re-anchored to 0be97503 (L-0520 PR 1 merges main 42af3fb7 (L-0531)); re-anchored to 14bb59ef (L-0520 PR 1 merges main 6a8c60b1 (T-0099)); re-anchored to 8bf710ed (L-0520 PR 1 review round 1 fixes); re-anchored to 14b52c91 (L-0520 PR 1 merges main bd4b2f30 (T-0028 #288, crew 1.0.85, and the mailgun skill), crew 1.0.86); re-anchored to 0c3508e9 (L-0520 PR 1 merges main f7caa37d (L-0561 #289: mailgun registered as skills/mailgun 1.0.1, both install scripts, README, INSTALLATION.md), crew stays 1.0.86); re-anchored to 6e581365 (T-0505 merges main 64b04c6b: W-0116 crew 1.0.89, runner auto-start #294; crew 1.0.91); re-anchored to 9580571e (T-0505 raises promote.md's line ceiling in .budget-allowance.json, crew 1.0.91); re-anchored to 89ebda03 (L-0558 merges main 52489039); L-0513 re-anchored fe524012 -> 4eacfacf -> 3437cbdd -> e41bc6fd -> 4a48f594 -> de32cb87 -> f23b01b4 (the gate runner scripts/gate-runner.py and its review fixes; repository tooling, no plugin version; per-step notes in this map's provenance), then merged with main 52489039 (T-0040, crew 1.0.98) and re-anchored to 71038cb9, then merged with main 05a679bf (L-0558, crew 1.0.102) and re-anchored to 0d159692
## Landmines
- The credential chain caches its winner for the process lifetime.
- `scopesOverride` silently broadens a narrow scope request.
- `dist/` is what runs, `src/` is what you edit.
- The stale-build gap in the TEST path is CLOSED (2026-09-06, commit `4e2bfb78`).
- `o365-user` does not use the admin credential chain at all.
- Each server pins an exact core version, not a range.
