# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning follows the `version` field on each plugin entry in [`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json) rather than a single repo-wide version, since skills ship independently.

## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet.

### Added

- DevOps scaffolding for distributing skills to the team: `Skill-Authoring-Standard.md`, `Skill-Pipeline.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `INSTALLATION.md`, `MARKETPLACE.md`, this `CHANGELOG.md`.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — registers this repo as a Claude Code plugin marketplace with one plugin entry per skill.
- `scripts/install-prerequisites.ps1` and `scripts/install-prerequisites.sh` — bootstrap Git, AWS CLI (Windows) / native package manager (Linux), Node.js, Python, the Claude Code CLI itself (with `PATH` export), and the team's standard marketplaces/plugins (Superpowers, find-skills, GSD, claude-mem, frontend-design, excalidraw-generator).
- Populated `skills/README.md` with a skill overview table (name, category, purpose, invocation mode) for all 10 skills.
- Root `README.md` now embeds the skills overview and links every new doc.
- Populated root `.gitignore`.

### Fixed

- `aws-opensearch` and `intune-graph` skill directories were double-nested (`skills/<name>/<name>/SKILL.md`), breaking the standard `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` discovery convention and marketplace `source` paths. Flattened to the standard layout.

### Skills present as of this baseline

`aws-opensearch`, `bitbucket`, `checkpoint-email`, `cloudflare`, `drata`, `i-have-adhd`, `intune-graph`, `mermaid-svg-bitbucket`, `sophos-central`, `wazuh-onprem` — see [`skills/README.md`](skills/README.md) for details on each.
