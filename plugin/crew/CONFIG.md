# crew configuration reference

Generated from the code by `python3 docs/guides/crew/src/config_reference.py --write`. Do not edit by hand:
`python3 scripts/check-marketplace.py` fails when this file is stale. The
reasoning behind the keys is in `docs/crew/config-rationale.md`.

87 keys: 50 settable in the machine-global file, 37 repo-only.

## The two layers

crew reads `~/.claude/crew/config.json` (the machine-global file: your
defaults for every repo on this machine) and `.crew/config.json` (the repo file:
facts about one checkout). The repo value wins over the machine value, which wins
over crew's built-in default, with these exceptions, each named in the Layer
column:

- A repo-only key in the machine file takes effect nowhere (pruned on read,
  refused on write).
- A ratcheted key resolves to the NARROWER of the two layers, so a cloned repo
  can tighten what your machine allows and never loosen it.
- A machine-arms key (`resume.auto`, `context.autoClear.enabled`,
  `context.autoClear.wrapUp`) is turned on only in the machine file; a repo can
  only veto it with `false`.
- A personal key (`crew_guards.PERSONAL_KEYS`) resolves per key to the stricter
  of the layers that set it; a layer that says nothing imposes nothing.
- A `null` in the repo file over a machine value inherits the machine value.
- In a linked git worktree with no config of its own, the main checkout's repo
  config is the one read.

## Guard profiles

`guards.profile` is one word for all twelve guards; `guards.overrides.<guard>`
replaces the profile's value for one guard. Each layer expands to a value per
guard, and the per-guard ratchet then takes the narrower layer. A malformed
profile or override reads as the guard's floor (`block`, or `none` for the
production guards), never as `off`. The per-guard keys of earlier versions
(`guards.<guard>`) are still READ as aliases for `guards.overrides.<guard>`
until `/crew:migrate` rewrites them, and are never written.

| Guard | `off` | `standard` | `strict` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `terraformApply` | `block` | `block` | `block` |
| `forcePush` | `block` | `block` | `block` |
| `adminMerge` | `block` | `ask` | `block` |
| `mergeGate` | `block` | `block` | `block` |
| `cloudDestructive` | `block` | `block` | `block` |
| `sqlDestructive` | `block` | `block` | `block` |
| `deployWorkflow` | `block` | `block` | `block` |
| `prodDatabase` | `none` | `none` | `none` |
| `prodServer` | `none` | `none` | `none` |
| `roleWrites` | `off` | `report` | `block` |
| `cloudGuard` | `off` | `block` | `block` |
| `envGuard` | `off` | `off` | `block` |

## Verify gate trust (a store, not a config key)

The Stop gate runs `.crew/verify.json` `run` strings (and, with no verify.json,
`_verify/smoke.sh` or `scripts/smoke.sh`) only for a repo this machine trusts.
Trust lives in `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/crew/verify-trust.json`, written
by `python3 plugin/crew/hooks/scripts/verify_trust.py` (`approve`, `revoke`,
`status`, `allow-owner`, `disallow-owner`) at a terminal. It is not a config key:
no repo file can widen it. An untrusted repo prints `UNTRUSTED, not run`, runs
nothing and records no pass; `--ci` is exempt. A store location a repo can author is
refused as UNKNOWN: a project's `.claude/settings.json` `env` block reaches hook processes
(measured 2026-10-25, claude 2.1.304), so `CREW_VERIFY_TRUST_FILE`, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and
`HOME` must name an absolute path outside the repo being checked.

Accepted residuals: `--price` opens its map, and `bash` reopens the smoke script, after the trust
check, so a process running as you that swaps the file in that interval runs the swapped bytes (you can
edit the store too). The scope guard is a textual tripwire, not a sandbox: the boundary is the OS user.

## Migrating and removed keys

`/crew:migrate` upgrades a repo file; `python3 plugin/crew/hooks/scripts/crew_migrate.py --global`
does the same for the machine file (preview, apply and rollback). It rewrites
`guards.*` into the profile with the fewest overrides and removes removed keys
that hold their default. A removed key holding another value stops the migration
until it is deleted or accepted with `--accept-dropped <key>`. 60 keys were
removed (ticket L-0725) and are now constants in `crew_state`
(`crew_dropped.DROPPED` lists each with its constant); a config still carrying
one is reported as having no effect (`crew_config.py --inert`, `/crew:status`, and the
SessionStart notice).

## `core` keys (14)

| Key | Layer | Default | Values | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `schema` | repo | `8` | not validated - read by `hooks/scripts/crew_state.py` (expects integer) | Config schema version; `/crew:migrate` upgrades an older one. |
| `verifyGate` | repo | `true` | not validated - read by `hooks/scripts/verify-gate.sh` (expects boolean) | Run the Stop verify gate. |
| `emergency.standDown` | repo | `true` | not validated - read by `hooks/scripts/_common.sh` (expects boolean) | Whether a declared incident may stand gates down; `false` forbids it. |
| `emergency.maxTtlMinutes` | repo | `480` | integer (coerced in `hooks/scripts/crew_incident.py`) | Longest incident lifetime; never below `ttlMinutes`. |
| `pm.authority` | both, widening warned | `"report-only"` | `report-only` \| `act` \| `autonomous` | How much the PM may do unasked. A widening is warned about; the two layers combine by precedence. |
| `pm.maxDispatches` | both | `3` | integer (coerced in `hooks/scripts/crew_state.py`) | Roles the PM may dispatch in one pass. |
| `graph.out` | repo | `"graphify-out"` | not validated - read by `hooks/scripts/crew_state.py` (expects path) | Where the code graph is written. |
| `install.policy` | both, ratchet | `"manual"` | `manual` \| `ask` \| `auto` (ratchet: narrower layer wins; listed narrowest first) | Whether crew may install a missing prerequisite. |
| `change.requireForProduction` | both, ratchet | `false` | `true` \| `false` (ratchet: narrower layer wins; listed narrowest first) | Require an approved change request before `/crew:promote production`: a repo may turn it on, never off. |
| `git.forbiddenTrailers` | both | `[]` | list of trailer tokens (letters, digits and `-`, no `:`) (checked in `hooks/scripts/crew_trailers.py`) | Commit trailer tokens the owner forbids, reported by `/crew:done`. The two layers combine by union, so a repo can add a token and never remove the machine owner's; a value that is not a list of tokens makes the list unknown, never empty (docs/crew/config-rationale.md). |
| `scope.mode` | repo | `"off"` | `off` \| `report` \| `block` \| `auto` | Whether the scope guard enforces a ticket's Touch list; a value outside these fails closed to `block`. |
| `scope.allowCliApproval` | repo | `false` | `false` \| `true` (checked in `hooks/scripts/crew_ticket.py`) | Whether a CLI-written approval receipt counts; only exactly `true` allows it. |
| `tickets.baseBranch` | repo | `null` | branch name or null (checked in `hooks/scripts/scope_base.py`) | The branch ticket branches are cut from; null tries origin/HEAD's target, then origin/main, then main. A value that is not a branch name, or names no commit, makes the scope base could not tell. |
| `route.enabled` | both | `false` | `false` \| `true` (checked in `hooks/scripts/crew_route.py`) | Route plain-text prompts to `/crew:` commands; only the JSON value `true` arms it. |

|---|---|---|---|---|
| `qa.provider` | both | `"auto"` | `auto` \| `claude` \| `codex` \| `copilot` \| `kimi` | Who reviews: `auto` walks `qa.order`; a named provider is used as-is. |

| `qa.kimi.model` | both | `null` | not validated - read by `commands/review.md` (expects string or null) | Kimi Code model id for review (`k3`, `kimi-for-coding`, ...); null uses the CLI's own default. |
| `qa.roles` | both | `{}` | object of role pins; each pin's provider is checked (checked in `hooks/scripts/crew_config.py`) | Per-role reviewer pins, `qa.roles.<role>.provider` / `.model`; a pin beats the provider block for that role. |

| `dev.fallback` | both | `"claude-sonnet-5"` | not validated - read by `skills/crew-providers/SKILL.md` (expects model id) | Model a gone dev pin falls back to, on its family's provider. |

| `dev.roles` | both | `{}` | object of role pins; each pin's provider is checked (checked in `hooks/scripts/crew_config.py`) | Per-role dev pins, as `qa.roles`. |
| `secondOpinion.provider` | both | `"none"` | not validated - read by `commands/plan.md` (expects string) | Second-opinion provider for plans; `none` is off. |

|---|---|---|---|---|
| `guards.profile` | both, ratchet | `"off"` | `off` \| `standard` \| `strict` | One word for the twelve guards: `off` (today's defaults), `standard` or `strict`. Expands per layer; each guard's ratchet then runs on the expanded values. |
| `guards.overrides` | both, ratchet | `{}` | object of guard name to tier (checked in `hooks/scripts/crew_guards.py`) | `guards.overrides.<guard>`: one guard's tier, replacing the profile's value for it. Each entry is checked against that guard's own tiers; a bad one reads as the floor. |

| `environments.workflows` | repo | `{}` | not validated - read by `hooks/scripts/crew_config.py` (expects object of glob to string) | Deploy workflow globs, each mapped to its environment or `input:<name>`. |
| `unattendedCloud.aws.readOnly.profile` | machine-only | `null` | profile name, or null (coerced in `hooks/scripts/crew_unattended.py`) | The AWS profile an unattended run exports credentials from (`aws configure export-credentials`); it must yield temporary credentials. Machine file only. |
| `unattendedCloud.aws.readOnly.identity` | machine-only | `null` | ARN prefix ending in `/`, or null (coerced in `hooks/scripts/crew_unattended.py`) | The assumed-role ARN prefix STS must report for that profile, ending in `/`; null refuses every launch. Machine file only. |
| `unattendedCloud.aws.readOnly.region` | machine-only | `null` | region, or null (coerced in `hooks/scripts/crew_unattended.py`) | The AWS region the unattended run gets; null is `us-east-1`. Machine file only. |

## `trackers` keys (5)

| Key | Layer | Default | Values | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| Key | Layer | Default | Values | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `autopilot.mode` | both, stricter wins | `"off"` | `off` \| `plan` \| `backlog` (checked in `hooks/scripts/crew_autopilot.py`); personal: listed strictest first, the stricter wins | Only the exact strings `plan` (one ticket per run) and `backlog` (L-0541: a goal's tickets in dependency order, inside the caps) arm `/crew:autopilot`; anything else reads as off, with a warning. |
| `autopilot.maxPhases` | both, stricter wins | `12` | positive integer (checked in `hooks/scripts/crew_autopilot.py`); personal: the smaller wins | Phases one run may take; anything but a positive integer reads as 12, with a warning. |
| `autopilot.deploy` | both, stricter wins | `"none"` | `none` \| `nonprod` \| `all`; personal: listed strictest first, the stricter wins | Where a deploy may run without asking; anything else reads as `none`. |
| `autopilot.approval` | both, stricter wins | `"risk"` | `human` \| `risk` \| `self`; personal: listed strictest first, the stricter wins | Who approves a ticket under autopilot; anything else reads as `human`. |
| `autopilot.questions` | both, stricter wins | `"risk"` | `human` \| `risk` \| `self`; personal: listed strictest first, the stricter wins | Who answers a ticket's open questions under autopilot; anything else reads as `human`. |
| `autopilot.maxAutoReplans` | repo | `0` | non-negative integer (checked in `hooks/scripts/crew_autopilot.py`) | Successor plans autopilot may start by rejecting an out-of-rounds BLOCK review itself; 0 is off, and anything but a non-negative integer reads as 0, and above 5 as 5, with a warning. |
| `autopilot.ship` | repo | `"merge"` | `pr` \| `merge` | After `/crew:done`: `pr` pushes and opens the PR; `merge` also merges it (a merge commit) once the required checks allow. Anything else reads as `pr`, with a warning. |
| `autopilot.sleep.schedule` | repo | `null` | HH:MM-HH:MM or null (checked in `hooks/scripts/crew_sleep.py`) | A nightly window, `HH:MM-HH:MM` in machine local time (may cross midnight); inside it the two sleep overrides apply. Anything else is could not tell: only a stricter override applies. |
| `autopilot.sleep.approval` | repo | `null` | `null` \| `human` \| `self` \| `risk` (checked in `hooks/scripts/crew_sleep.py`) | `autopilot.approval` inside the sleep window; null keeps the day value; anything else counts as human, the strictest, with a warning. |
| `autopilot.sleep.questions` | repo | `null` | `null` \| `human` \| `self` \| `risk` (checked in `hooks/scripts/crew_sleep.py`) | `autopilot.questions` inside the sleep window; null keeps the day value; anything else counts as human, the strictest, with a warning. |
| `autopilot.sleep.deploy` | repo | `null` | `null` \| `nonprod` \| `none` (checked in `hooks/scripts/crew_sleep.py`) | `autopilot.deploy` inside the sleep window (L-0654): null keeps the day value, `nonprod` or `none` replaces it; anything else, `all` included, is refused with a warning. Asleep, an effective `all` reads as `nonprod`: production never runs unattended asleep. |
| `autopilot.maxTicketsPerRun` | repo | `3` | positive integer (checked in `hooks/scripts/crew_autopilot_backlog.py`) | Tickets one goal run (one session) may start; the next one stops the run. Anything but a positive integer reads as 3, with a warning. |
| `autopilot.maxTokensPerSession` | repo | `2000000` | positive integer (checked in `hooks/scripts/crew_autopilot_backlog.py`) | Input plus output tokens one goal session may spend, each assistant message counted once, before the run stops; a transcript that cannot be read stops too. Anything but a positive integer reads as 2000000, with a warning. |
| `autopilot.maxLanes` | repo | `null` | positive integer or null (checked in `hooks/scripts/crew_wave.py`) | Lanes one `/crew:autopilot wave` runs at once; null is the resolved `pm.maxDispatches`, a larger value is capped to it and anything but a positive integer reads as it, each with a warning. |
| `autopilot.reviewPolicy` | repo | `"stop"` | `stop` \| `clean-only` \| `fix-and-rereview` | What autopilot does with a review verdict. A wave lane: `stop` ends at the first verdict, `clean-only` takes a CLEAN round on to the done checks, `fix-and-rereview` fixes within the ledger's rounds. A single-ticket run (T-0067): only `fix-and-rereview` acts, fixing a non-final FINDINGS round's BLOCK and FIX lines itself (the `fix` phase) and re-reviewing. Anything else reads as `stop`, with a warning; no setting accepts a review. |

## `context` keys (11)

| Key | Layer | Default | Values | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `context.enabled` | repo | `true` | not validated - read by `hooks/scripts/context-watch.sh` (expects boolean) | Run the context watcher. |
| `context.warnAt` | repo | `0.4` | not validated - read by `hooks/scripts/context-watch.sh` (expects number) | Fraction of the budget at which the watcher warns, wraps up and auto-clears; default 0.4 since 1.2.40 (was 0.5), an explicit value is kept. |
| `context.reserveTokens` | repo | `0` | not validated - read by `hooks/scripts/context-watch.sh` (expects integer or null) | Tokens held back from the budget; `null` means off. |
| `context.autoClear.enabled` | machine-arms | `null` | `null` \| `true` \| `false` (checked in `hooks/scripts/crew_autocycle.py`) | Auto-clear after a wrap-up. Only the machine file can arm it (exactly `true`); a repo `false` vetoes it. |
| `context.autoClear.method` | both | `"auto"` | `auto` \| `none` \| `notify` \| `tmux` \| `xdotool` \| `wtype`; per OS: linux: auto, none, notify, tmux, xdotool, wtype; macos: auto, none, notify, tmux; windows: auto, none, notify; windows-bash: auto, none, notify, tmux | How `/clear` is typed. `auto` picks per platform; a method this OS lacks stands auto-clear down. |
| `context.autoClear.delaySeconds` | both | `3` | number (coerced in `hooks/scripts/crew_autocycle.py`) | Delay before typing; an unusable value warns and reads as 3. |
| `context.autoClear.minHandoffLines` | both | `5` | number (coerced in `hooks/scripts/crew_autocycle.py`) | Shortest handoff that may be cleared after; a non-number reads as 5. |
| `context.autoClear.onlyRepos` | machine-only | `null` | list of absolute repo paths, or null (coerced in `hooks/scripts/crew_autocycle.py`) | Narrowing only, machine file only: null narrows nothing, a list arms only those repos, `[]` or a non-list arms nothing. |
| `context.autoClear.onlySessions` | machine-only | `null` | list of session ids, or null (coerced in `hooks/scripts/crew_autocycle.py`) | As `onlyRepos`, for session ids; with both set, both must match. |
| `context.autoClear.wrapUp` | machine-arms | `null` | `null` \| `true` \| `false` (checked in `hooks/scripts/crew_autocycle.py`) | Auto wrap-up before auto-clear (T-0017): the warning becomes the wrap-up procedure and the clear waits for its results. Only the machine file arms it (exactly `true`), only where `enabled` is armed; a repo `false` vetoes it. |
| `resume.auto` | machine-arms | `null` | `null` \| `true` \| `false` (checked in `hooks/scripts/crew_resume.py`) | Auto-resume after `/clear` or a manual `/compact`. Only the machine file can arm it (exactly `true`); a repo `false` vetoes it. |

## `notify` keys (4)

| Key | Layer | Default | Values | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `notify.provider` | both | `null` | telegram, teams, none or null; any other value sends nothing (coerced in `hooks/scripts/crew_notify.py`) | Where notifications go: `telegram`, `teams` or `none` (off). A repo null inherits the machine provider; a repo `none` opts this repo out. |
| `notify.tokenEnv` | machine-only | `null` | not validated - read by `hooks/scripts/crew_notify.py` (expects string or null) | Name of the environment variable holding the Telegram bot token; null may be filled from the notify skill's `bot_token_env`. Honoured from the machine file only. |

The pre-1.0 names `gate`, `waiting`, `phase`, `review` and `done` are mapped with a notice. A list is one leaf. |

## `memory` keys (2)
