  # needs to match `_common.sh`'s bare `crew_py()`; this one needs to match
  # role-write-guard.sh's OWN resolver, which does more than `crew_py()`
  # does, so this copy has to as well.
  #
  # Two bugs, reported together 2026-09-19 by a PowerShell-focused review of
  # THIS file specifically, on top of the WindowsApps/profile-shadow guards
  # this function already had:
  #
  #   1. Metadata alone (`.CommandType` / `.Source`) is exactly what a
  #      WindowsApps stub already passes -- `Get-Command` reports it as a
  #      real Application with a real Source. role-write-guard.sh's own
  #      resolver does not trust that either: it EXECUTES the candidate
  #      (`$cand -c "import sys;print(sys.executable)"`) and reads back
  #      what actually ran. This copy now does the same, rejecting a
  #      candidate that produces no output when actually launched.
  #   2. `Get-Command $name -All` walked every match for ONE name before
  #      moving to the next name -- so on `PATH=WindowsApps;RealDir` with
  #      only `python3` present anywhere (no `python`/`py` at all), the old
  #      code walked PAST the WindowsApps `python3` stub and found
  #      RealDir's `python3` further down PATH. Bash's `command -v
  #      python3` (role-write-guard.sh's resolver) takes only the FIRST
  #      match for a name; rejecting it moves to the NEXT NAME, never a
  #      second search of the same one -- so the .sh abandoned `python3`
  #      after the stub and never found a `python`/`py` that did not
  #      exist either. Same PATH, same machine: one shell flavour
  #      enforced `guards.roleWrites: block` and the other silently
  #      allowed the write unjudged. This copy now takes only the first
  #      match per name too, mirroring the .sh's name-order exactly.
