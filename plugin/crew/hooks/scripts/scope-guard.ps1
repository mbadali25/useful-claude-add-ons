  # EVERY PATH match of every name is a candidate, and each is EXECUTED
  # before it is believed; where it lives never decides. A WindowsApps App
  # Execution Alias is tried like anything else: it forwards to a working
  # interpreter when Python is installed and fails the probe when it is not.
  # Windows burn-in 2026-09-23 (docs/review/06-windows-burn-in.md, 2c): the
  # previous copy skipped WindowsApps by path and took only the first match
  # per name, so on a host whose python, python3 and py were all working
  # WindowsApps aliases it discarded all three untested, never reached the
  # real python.exe further down PATH, and completion-audit.ps1 blocked
  # every Stop while its bash twin proceeded.
  #
  # PROOF, not a printed line. The candidate must answer one JSON object
  # only a Python can build: {"v": [major, minor], "exe": sys.executable,
  # "impl": sys.implementation.name}. Accepted only when it exits 0, the
  # JSON parses, impl is cpython or pypy (the two implementations the hooks
  # are run under; anything else is rejected rather than guessed at), v is
  # at least [3, 8] (the floor crew's python targets), and exe exists as a
  # file. A program that ignores -c and prints some existing path -- which
  # the previous "print(sys.executable)" probe accepted -- fails the parse.
  #
  # The probe is bounded: it runs to completion or its WHOLE PROCESS TREE is
  # killed at 3s, with stdout and stderr read asynchronously so a chatty
  # candidate cannot fill a pipe and hang. The tree, not the candidate: a
  # py.exe-style launcher starts a child interpreter that inherits the
  # redirected handles, and killing only the launcher leaves that child
  # running. Kill($true) is the tree kill on PowerShell 7 (.NET Core 3+);
  # Windows PowerShell 5.1 has no such overload, so it falls back to
  # taskkill /T /F. No `continue` inside try/catch: loop control across that
  # boundary differs between PowerShell versions, so the verdict is carried
  # out in $real and acted on after it.
  # An OVERALL deadline on top of each candidate's own 3s probe bound: a
  # PATH with several hung candidates would otherwise cost 3s EACH, adding
  # up past the shortest hook timeout that calls this (bridge-status.ps1's
  # twin, 10s) even though every individual probe is bounded. Kept well
  # inside that.
