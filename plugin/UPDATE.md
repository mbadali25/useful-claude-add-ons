# Plugin updates

New capability added under `plugin/`, newest first. Each entry names the version
it landed in, so a reader can tell what their installed copy actually has. For
fixes and internal changes, see [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md); this file is
only what is newly *possible*.

Mirrored into [`plugin/README.md`](README.md) and the root
[`README.md`](../README.md) by `scripts/sync-updates.py`. Edit here, then run it.

## crew 0.15.1

Three new agents and a skill, taking crew to 14 agents and 17 bundled skills.

| Added | What it does |
|---|---|
| `infrastructure-architect` | Designs and reviews AWS network and account architecture — VPCs, routing, connectivity, DNS, ingress, landing zones. Returns the design with its tradeoffs. Never applies anything to a live account. |
| `scribe` | Keeps the durable record: ADRs, CHANGELOG entries, handoff notes, and what was tried and rejected. ADRs are append-only — a correction is a new ADR, never an edit to the old one. |
| `researcher` | External research only — library and SDK docs at the version actually pinned, API behaviour, vendor limits, standards. Every claim carries its source; it refuses to answer a version, a limit, or an API surface from memory. |
| `crew-house-style` skill | House style for documents a human will read: format choice, headings, capitalization, palette. Routes to the office and diagram skills rather than reimplementing generation. |

Also in 0.15.0:

- **`docs-writer` exports for humans.** Documentation a person will consume ships
  as HTML, DOCX or PDF, not raw markdown. The markdown under `docs/` stays the
  source of truth — the export is an additional artifact, so anything reading
  those paths keeps working. Repo-native files (`CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, ADRs) stay markdown, because exporting one breaks the tool that
  reads it. `docs-writer` also gained the return contract it never had.
- **`dba` covers DynamoDB as its own model**, not as a row in a relational
  checklist — access-pattern-first, single-table design, partition-key
  cardinality, GSI backfill cost, the creation-time-only nature of LSIs, and the
  400KB item limit. Relational review is now split by engine, because lock
  behaviour under `ALTER TABLE` differs across Postgres, MySQL/InnoDB and SQL
  Server, and the old text applied Postgres vocabulary to all three.
- **`planner` asks what a decision forecloses** — whether it is one-way, what
  undoing it costs later, and the cheapest experiment that would settle it before
  committing.
- **Agents can now load the skills they cite.** Eight agents referenced a crew
  skill without declaring `skills:` frontmatter, so the reference was decoration:
  naming a skill does not load it. `browser-tester`, `docs-writer`,
  `infrastructure-architect`, `planner`, `pm`, `qa-reviewer`, `scribe` and
  `smoke-author` now declare what they cite.
- **`explorer` no longer orders a write it cannot perform.** It held
  `Read, Grep, Glob` and was told to append findings to memory; it now returns a
  `**Durable:**` block for its caller to persist.
- **The PM's guards apply on every path.** Removal needing an explicit yes was
  previously gated to `authority: act`, which switched it off exactly when a user
  told a `report-only` PM to go ahead.
