# SessionStart hook. PowerShell twin of bridge-status.sh -- both delegate to
# bridge_status.py so neither can drift from the other.

# Flavour guard. Both flavours are registered for every event, so on a host
# that has BOTH interpreters both would otherwise run. Stand down only when
# we can positively prove this is not Windows.
#
# $env:OS is 'Windows_NT' on BOTH Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7,
# and unset on Linux/macOS. A bare `if (-not $IsWindows)` is WRONG: $IsWindows
# does not exist in 5.1, so it is $null there, `-not $null` is $true, and the
# hook stands down on the one platform it exists for. crew has already shipped
# that bug once - the guard stood down on Windows and blocked nothing there.
