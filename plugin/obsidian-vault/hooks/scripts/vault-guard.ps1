# PostToolUse hook. PowerShell twin of vault-guard.sh -- both delegate to
# vault_guard.py so neither can drift from the other. This hook can BLOCK
# (exit 2), so unlike bridge-status.ps1 the exit code is not silenced.
#
# No interpreter found: stand down with exit 0 rather than fail closed (exit
# 2). The two contract rules - frontmatter and ASCII - ship OFF until a
# vault's own CLAUDE.md turns one on, so losing those is no worse than the
# guard never being configured. The canvas shape check does NOT: checkCanvas
# defaults ON (vault_guard.py:243), so a missing interpreter does drop one
# check that would otherwise be running.
#
# Exit 0 is still right, and PostToolUse is why: the write has already landed,
# so exit 2 would not prevent a malformed canvas - it would only report one
# the guard never checked for, on every write, because python is missing. A
# false report is worse than a loud stand-down, so it says so on stderr.
